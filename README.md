# FairFrame

FairFrame is a modular fairness auditing challenge inspired by real-world issues in financial services and machine learning systems. It is structured in three levelsâ€”Beginner, Intermediate, and Advancedâ€”to simulate bias detection across AI components used by a fictional fintech company.

## ðŸ§  Challenge Scenario

Banking Access, a fictional company, uses AI/ML systems across:

Loan Risk Estimator (credit scoring)

Account Promotion Recommender (targeted offers)

Customer Service Chatbot (LLM-based)

Participants are invited to audit these systems step by step for potential biases across protected attributes such as gender, caste, religion, and accent.

## ðŸ”¹ Levels

## ðŸŸ¢ Beginner

Explore `loan_data.csv`

Identify disparities in loan scoring and approval rates

Use descriptive stats and basic visualizations

## ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate

Add analysis of `promotion_data.csv`

Compare promotion distributions by group

Evaluate bias across two systems

## ðŸ”´ Advanced

Incorporate `chatbot_output.csv`

Score LLM-based chatbot replies for bias

Consider fairness trade-offs across multiple systems

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Notes

All datasets are synthetic and were generated using the script in data_generation/. Biases were manually injected for gender, caste, and religion in scores and exposure.
