3. Quantify group fairness using:
   - Disparate Impact Ratio
   - Promotion Exposure Rate
4. Recommend one mitigation idea (e.g., reweighting, sampling, policy change)

## ✅ Deliverable
- Short notebook or script showing:
  - Summary stats
  - Bias metric calculations
  - One visualization per system
  - A written recommendation
